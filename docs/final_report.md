# Microsoft Fabric Terraform PoC - Final Report

## Executive Summary
This Proof of Concept (PoC) evaluated the deployment of Microsoft Fabric Cloud resources via Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using Terraform. We compared the Microsoft Fabric Terraform provider and the AzureRM provider for Fabric resources, tested different authentication methods, and documented limitations and workarounds.

The PoC successfully demonstrated that both providers can be used effectively to deploy and manage Microsoft Fabric resources, with each provider having specific strengths and use cases. All acceptance criteria were met, and reusable Terraform modules were created for both providers.

## Acceptance Criteria Status
| Criteria | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Fabric deployment via fabric tf provider (tf module) | ✅ Completed | Created module for Fabric workspaces |
| Fabric Capacity deployment via azurerm tf provider (tf module) | ✅ Completed | Created module for Fabric Capacity |
| Known limitation investigation and listing of potential workarounds | ✅ Completed | Documented in limitations_and_workarounds.md |
| Wiki page stating test use cases, ticket reference and outcome | ✅ Completed | Created comprehensive wiki documentation |

## Key Findings

### Provider Comparison
- **AzureRM Provider**: Best suited for Fabric Capacity deployment, with full support for both authentication methods
- **Microsoft Fabric Provider**: Required for Fabric-specific resources like workspaces, with better support for Azure CLI authentication

### Authentication Methods
- **Azure CLI**: Recommended for development and testing; works with all resources
- **Managed Identity**: Better for production and CI/CD pipelines; has limitations with some Fabric resources

### Limitations and Workarounds
- Microsoft Fabric trial capacity is not supported; use self-provisioned Fabric Capacity on Azure
- Not all Fabric resources support Service Principals; use Azure CLI authentication where needed
- Resource dependencies must be carefully managed between providers

## Deliverables
1. **Terraform Modules**:
   - Fabric provider module for workspace management
   - AzureRM provider module for Fabric Capacity deployment
   - Test environment configurations for both authentication methods

2. **Documentation**:
   - Research findings on both providers
   - Limitations and workarounds documentation
   - Wiki page with test cases and outcomes
   - This final report

## Recommendations
1. **Provider Selection**:
   - Use AzureRM provider for Fabric Capacity deployment
   - Use Microsoft Fabric provider for Fabric-specific resources
   - Combine both providers for complete Fabric resource management

2. **Authentication Strategy**:
   - For development and testing: Use Azure CLI authentication
   - For production and CI/CD pipelines: Use Managed Identity where supported
   - Consider using a hybrid approach where necessary

3. **Next Steps**:
   - Implement these modules in a CI/CD pipeline for automated deployment
   - Expand the modules to include additional Fabric resources as they become available
   - Monitor for updates to both providers as Microsoft Fabric evolves

## Conclusion
The Microsoft Fabric PoC has successfully demonstrated that Infrastructure as Code can be used to manage Microsoft Fabric resources, enabling automated deployment and consistent configuration across environments. The created Terraform modules provide a solid foundation for future Fabric deployments and can be extended as needed.
