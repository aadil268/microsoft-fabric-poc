# Test Results and Authentication Methods Comparison

## Test Environment Setup
We've created two test configurations to evaluate both authentication methods:

1. **Azure CLI Authentication** (`azure_cli_auth.tf`)
   - Uses `use_cli = true` for the Fabric provider
   - Default authentication for AzureRM provider

2. **Managed Identity Authentication** (`managed_identity_auth.tf`)
   - Uses `use_msi = true` for all providers
   - Requires proper MSI setup on the deployment environment

## Test Results

### Azure CLI Authentication
- **Pros**:
  - Simpler to set up for development and testing
  - Recommended by Microsoft for Fabric provider evaluation
  - Works with all Fabric resources
  - No additional configuration needed beyond Azure CLI login
- **Cons**:
  - Requires manual login, not suitable for automated pipelines
  - Credentials are tied to the user account

### Managed Identity Authentication
- **Pros**:
  - Better for automated deployments and CI/CD pipelines
  - No credential management required
  - More secure (no secrets stored)
- **Cons**:
  - Not all Fabric resources support Service Principals yet
  - Requires additional setup for the Managed Identity
  - More complex to configure and troubleshoot

## Implementation Notes
- Both authentication methods are implemented in the modules
- The AzureRM provider has better support for Managed Identity than the Fabric provider
- For production use, the authentication method should be chosen based on the deployment environment and security requirements

## Recommendations
- For development and testing: Use Azure CLI authentication
- For production and CI/CD pipelines: Use Managed Identity where supported
- Consider using a combination approach where necessary (AzureRM with MSI, Fabric with CLI)
